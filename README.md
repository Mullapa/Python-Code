As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store app, my goal is to dig deeper into our sales data to understand patterns better. Even though Instacart is doing well, we believe there's more to learn. My task is to analyze the data we have and come up with insights that will help us segment our customers more effectively and suggest strategies to improve sales even further.

# Introduction:
Instacart wants to understand its customers better to improve how they sell groceries. They know that not everyone shops the same way, so they're thinking about using different marketing strategies for different types of customers. Your job is to analyze the data and help figure out which strategies might work best for different groups of customers.


# Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
